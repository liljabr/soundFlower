 * A simple applet where the user can sketch curves in a variety of

 * The user can select a drawing color by clicking on a color in the
 * palette.  Under the colors is a "Clear button" that the user
 * can press to clear the sketch.  The user draws by clicking and
 * dragging in a large white area that occupies most of the applet.
 * The user's drawing is not persistent.  It is lost whenever
 * the applet is repainted for any reason.
 * <p>The drawing that is done in this example violates the rule
 * that all drawing should be done in the paintComponent() method.
 * Although it works, it is NOT good style.
 * <p>This class also contains a main program, and it can be run as
 * a stand-alone application that has exactly the same functionality
 * as the applet.
